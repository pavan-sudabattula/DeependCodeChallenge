# DeependCodeChallenge
The web application will be a cheque app with two screens, one to see a list of cheques and the second to see the cheque details.

Steps to set up solution:
1) Make sure NodeJs and NPM are installed.
2) Download/Clone this repository and open command prompt in the downloaded folder.
3) Run the following command:  "npm install". This should download all the dependent node packages into the working folder.
4) Run the following command: "npm start". This should build the application and show the page in browser.

Note:
As instructed, to keep it simple, the cheques are coming from a json object in "src\app\services\backend.service.ts". The same can be altered to obtain data from different sources by making API calls.
